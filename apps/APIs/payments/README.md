## Description

The **Payments** Microservice, centered around the '**Payment**' model, enables efficient management and moderation of payments within your application. It provides functionalities to create, update, and delete payments, create Stripe checkout sessions, and set up webhook listeners related to Stripe.<br>The microservice is equipped to handle both offline payments and Stripe payment processing. Additionally, it can be extended to accommodate additional payment providers to meet the requirements of future projects.

## Environement Variables

The comments microservice requires a few environement variables in order to function:

- PORT
- MICROSERVICE_NAME

### Stripe related Variables

- STRIPE_SECRET_KEY
- ENDPOINT_SECRET
- TERMS_OF_SERVICE_LINK

> **ENDPOINT_SECRET:** > **(Stripe)**  
> Your Webhook Signing Secret for this endpoint (e.g., 'whsec\_...').
> You can get this [in your stripe dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/webhooks).

---

> **TERMS_OF_SERVICE_LINK:** > **Collect a terms of service agreement (Stripe)**  
> Businesses often require their customers to agree to their terms of service before they can pay. This might depend on the type of product or subscription. Checkout helps you collect the necessary agreement by requiring a customer to accept your terms before paying.

## Payment model Schemas

```typescript
const schema = new Schema<PaymentType, PaymentModel>(
  {
    authID: { type: String, required: true },
    orderId: { type: String, required: true },
    amount: { type: Number, required: true },
    currency: { type: String, required: true },
    status: {
      type: String,
      enum: PaymentStatus,
      required: true,
      default: PaymentStatus.PENDING,
    },
    provider: {
      name: { type: String, enum: PaymentProviderEnum, required: true },
      reference: { type: String, required: true },
      meta: { type: Object, required: false },
    },
  },
  { timestamps: true }
);
```

### Payment Model

| Field Name  | Type              | description                                                                         | Required? |
| ----------- | ----------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------- |
| authID      | string            | Unique identifier for the authorized user initiating the payment.                   | true      |
| orderId     | string            | Unique identifier for the order associated with the payment.                        | true      |
| amount      | number            | The monetary amount of the payment.                                                 | true      |
| currency    | string            | The currency in which the payment is made (e.g., USD, EUR).                         | true      |
| status      | string            | The current status of the payment as [Payment Status Enum](#payment-status)         | true      |
| provider\*  | object            | Information about the payment provider used, consisting of the following subfields: | true      |
| - name      | string            | The name of the payment provider (e.g., Stripe, PayPal).                            | true      |
| - reference | string            | A unique identifier associated with the payment provider.                           | true      |
| - meta      | object (optional) | Additional metadata related to the payment associated with the payment provider     | false     |

- The '**provider**' field within the Payment Model is vital for specifying the [**payment provider**](#payment-provider-enum) and its details.
  - Depending on the provider, additional information might be required.
